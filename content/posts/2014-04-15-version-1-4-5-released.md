## Version 1.4.5

Version 1.4.5 has been released. Thanks to everyone who contributed!

**Important**: This version fixes a potential XSS exploit where if someone loaded malicious BBCode into the editor (i.e. editing a malicious users BBCode) it could cause an XSS exploit. This does not affect the XHTML plugin as all XHTML, regardless of source, should be filtered server side unless it's from a trusted user. See the [XHTML plugin warning](/documentation/formats/xhtml/#xhtml) for more information.

Other than that this version is mostly just bug fixes, there are a few new translations as well as the new indent/outdent commands.

Also there is a [bug in jQuery](http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14386) that causes IE 11 not to work. This is fixed in jQuery version 1.10.2 and above.
