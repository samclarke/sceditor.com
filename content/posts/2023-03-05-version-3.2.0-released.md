This release adds two new options, `allowedTags` and `allowedAttributes` to allow custom elements and attributes. In previous versions custom elements and attributes would be stripped by the HTML sanitiser.

There are also multiple fixes around pasting and improvements to multiple translations as well as a new Finnish translation.

Thanks to everyone who contributed!
